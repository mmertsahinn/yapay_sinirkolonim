## Project Overview

**Football Brain Core** is an advanced AI system designed to "learn" football team behaviors, predict match outcomes across multiple markets (Result, Over/Under, BTTS, etc.), and provide explainable insights ("Thoughts").

It goes beyond simple statistical regression by maintaining a "Deep Subjective Reality" for each team, understanding their specific form cycles, home/away personalities, and interaction patterns with specific opponents.
